<h3>Prediction of Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA)<br>
        from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) data collected<br>
        by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).</h3>

<p><b><a href="/~relh/">Return to meta index</a>.</b></p>
<p>The columns are the:</p>
<ul>
        <li>index of network in the list</li>
        <li>image of a visualization from the network input</li>
        <li>image of a visualization from the network output</li>
        <li>name of the network</li>
        <li>date that the model was last saved</li>
        <li>epoch it was saved after</li> 
        <li>delta time in the future being predicted</li> 
        <li>loss that it achieved</li> 
</ul>

<h3>A/H 2 A/H: AIA/HMI 2 AIA/HMI</h3>
<p>The a/h 2 a/h models convert AIA/HMI data to AIA/HMI frequencies. The input is 
the 9 channels on the left (or 3 Helioseismic and Magnetic Images) and the output 
is the 9 channels on the right (or HMI). These are either ground truth or the
output of a network, respectively. The metrics are computed across the entire validation set.
The A/H specific columns are:
<ul>
        <li>average of per pixel relative difference, (y-y_hat) / y</li> 
        <li>average of per pixel absolute difference, y-y_hat</li> 
        <li>percent of pixels within 10% of ground truth</li> 
        <li>percent of pixels within 20% of ground truth</li> 
        <li>percent of pixels within 50% of ground truth</li> 
</ul>

<h3>S2F: Stats 2 Flare</h3>
<p>The s2f models are all trained on converting statistics from AIA and HMI data to GOES<br>
flare predictions. The input to each model is the following statistics from all 12 HMI and AIA channels:<br>
mean, std, sum, absolute value sum, min, max, median, mode, and range. The SF specific columns are:</p>

<ul>
        <li>mAP of the classifier</li> 
        <li>accuracy of the classifier</li> 
        <li>Heidke Skill Score of classifier</li> 
        <li>F1 score of the classififer</li> 
</ul><br>
<p>The AH pages are sorted by the best pixels within 10% of the truth measure, with intra (but NOT inter)<br>
page sorting possible. The SF pages are sorted by the accuracy of the classifier. Click on a table header to
sort by that measure. Alternatively, the columns are from the classification task and represent a number of
relevant metrics.</p>
